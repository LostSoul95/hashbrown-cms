## Reducing time for loading dependencies in Node.js

The key ideas is to change from running ``npm install`` every time when your web changes to running only when its dependencies changed. We caches the whole node_modules folder, and save it to a docker commit. If your dependencies are not changed, docker can reuse the old commit for building the new one, significantly saving your docker image building time!
